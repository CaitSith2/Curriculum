  description: "CAUTION: CHECK YOUR MANUAL AGAIN: Curriculum has gone through some
    drastic changes in the last update, so you better re-read your refreshed manual
    completely and carefully.\n\nThis module aims to make you want to go back to college
    just so you can use a better scheduling system. Anything would be better than
    this.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to clutterArranger for all the help with the technical
    stuff.\r\n\r\nModule ID: curriculum\r\n\r\nManual PDF: https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Curriculum.html"
