				<li>You have been lazy through your summer vacation, so taking classes quickly became a matter of life and death- literally.
				<li>On the bomb there is a grid for your schedule, buttons for the five classes you have to take, and a SUBMIT button.
				<li>Take the first five characters of the serial number into consideration for the next table. (If the character is a letter, simply convert it to its numeric value.)

				<li>These classes are scattered randomly to the 5 buttons presented to you. As a hint, they are marked with their initials as you cycle.
				<li>Each class has 3 different sections that is available, each of which has 2-3 lectures throughout the week.
				<li>You should prepare a schedule with the correct classes and with the sections of your choosing. However, by default, you should have <u>zero</u> conflicts.
				<li>There are also conditions which may or may not affect your schedule:
